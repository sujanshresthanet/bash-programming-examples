File and Directory Operations Script Examples
====================================

This is a simple interactive Bash script that provides a variety of file and directory operations that can be performed through a menu-driven interface. The script offers 30 different operations, such as creating files and directories, renaming files, checking disk usage, appending to files, and more. The user can interact with the script by choosing an operation, and after each operation, the script will ask whether the user wants to continue or exit.

This script supports the following file and directory operations:

*   Create a new file

*   Rename a file or directory
*   Delete a file
*   Delete a directory
*   Copy a file
*   Move a file
*   Display contents of a file
*   Check file type
*   Change file permissions
*   Search for a file in the current directory
*   Display disk usage
*   Find large files
*   Check disk space
*   Display file properties
*   Create an empty directory structure
*   Display system uptime
*   Find files by name
*   Find files by size
*   Display the first few lines of a file
*   Display the last few lines of a file
*   Compare two files
*   Display file differences
*   Append data to a file
*   Create a symbolic link
*   Change file ownership
*   Change file group
*   Check file hash (checksum)
*   Exit the script

How to Run the Script
---------------------

1.  Save the script to a file, e.g., `file_operations.sh`.
2.  Give the script execute permission by running the following command in your terminal:
    
        chmod +x file_operations.sh
    
3.  Run the script by executing:
    
        ./file_operations.sh
    

Usage
-----

When you run the script, it will display a menu of available operations. You will be prompted to enter your choice, and based on your input, the script will perform the corresponding operation. After each operation, the script will ask if you want to continue. If you type "yes", it will return to the main menu; otherwise, the script will exit.

**Note:** The script assumes you have basic knowledge of the terminal, and that the necessary files and directories exist or can be created. Be cautious when running operations like file deletion or modifying file permissions.

Sample Script Flow

When you run the script, it will show a menu like the following:

Once you make a selection (e.g., 1 for creating a new file), the script will prompt you for the required input (e.g., the filename). After performing the operation, it will ask if you want to continue.

Example of a File Operation
---------------------------

Here's an example of how to create a new file:

    
        Enter your choice [1-30]: 1
        Enter the file name to create: myfile.txt
        File 'myfile.txt' created.
        Do you want to continue? (yes/no): yes
        

Important Notes
---------------

*   The script will not ask for confirmation before deleting files or directories. Please be careful when performing operations like **deleting a file** or **changing file permissions**.
*   Ensure you have the necessary permissions for performing operations on the files or directories (e.g., creating files, changing ownership).
