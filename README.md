Bash Programming Examples
=========================

This repository contains various Bash scripting examples to help you learn and practice different Bash programming concepts.

Introduction to Bash Script
=========================
A Bash script is a file containing a series of commands that are executed in sequence by the Bash shell (Bourne Again SHell), a widely used command-line interpreter on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. Bash scripts allow users to automate tasks, manage system configurations, manipulate files, and perform complex operations without having to manually type each command.

In a Bash script, commands can be combined with conditional statements, loops, functions, and variables to create efficient workflows. Whether you're performing administrative tasks, setting up environments, or managing backups, Bash scripts can simplify and speed up repetitive processes.

A Bash script typically starts with a shebang (#!/bin/bash) line to specify the interpreter, followed by a series of commands and logic. Bash scripts can be executed from the terminal by providing their file path or making them executable.

Bash scripting is an essential skill for system administrators, developers, and anyone working in a Unix-based environment, enabling them to perform powerful automation and system management tasks.

How to Run the Script
---------------------

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
        git clone https://github.com/sujanshresthanet/bash-programming-examples.git
    
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    
        cd bash-programming-examples
    
3.  **Make the script executable:**
    
        chmod +x example.sh
    
4.  **Run the script:**
    
        ./example.sh
    

Make All \`.sh\` Files Executable
---------------------------------

If you want to make all \`.sh\` files in the directory executable, you can use the following command:

    chmod +x *.sh

This command makes every \`.sh\` script in the directory executable, so you can run them easily with `./script_name.sh`.
